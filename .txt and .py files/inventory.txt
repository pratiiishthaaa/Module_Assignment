The Thirsty Crow

Once upon a time, there was a crow who was very thirsty. It searched for water everywhere but could not find any. After a long search, the crow finally saw a pitcher with a little water in it.

The crow tried to drink the water but the pitcher was too deep and the water level was too low. The crow thought hard about how to get the water. Suddenly, it had an idea. It picked up some pebbles one by one and dropped them into the pitcher. 

With each pebble, the water level rose a little higher. Finally, the water was high enough for the crow to drink. The crow was very happy and quenched its thirst. It had solved the problem through clever thinking.

The moral of the story is: Necessity is the mother of invention.
